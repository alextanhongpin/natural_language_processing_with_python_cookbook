    "\n",
    "There was an old owl that lived in an oak. Everyday he saw incidents happening around him. Yesterday he saw a boy helping an old man to carry a heavy basket. Today he saw a girl shouting at her mother. The more he saw the less he spoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As he spoke less, he heard more. He heard people talking and telling stories. He heard a woman saying that an elephant jumped over a fence. He also heard a man saying that he had never made a mistake.\n",

    "One day, the black sheep noticed that he had some more wool left. He thought, ‘It would be such a waste if nobody wants to buy the wool.’\n",

    "That afternoon, an old man came over to his wooden shed to see him. He wanted one bag full of the black sheep’s wool. Then an old woman came over. She also wanted a bag full of wool. A short while later, a little boy arrived. He also wanted one bag full of wool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the black sheep prepared three bags full of wool for them. He was happy that all of his wool was sold off.\n",
